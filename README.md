##### thanks to eraser1 for global messaging from his DMS
Developed for Exile mod, but is easily adaptable to any mod/mode. You would just have to update the item/weapon config in the fn_configuration.sqf

Also, its a servermod, so clients are  not required to download

##Install:
Literally, pack the folder into a pbo, and drop it in a server addon or add one for it. 

##Or use the one included
Rapped with Makepbo using line

`MakePbo -X none -Z "*.bin,*.cpp,*.txt,*.jpg,*.paa,*ogg,*.fsm" "custom_code" custom_code.pbo`

To derap, usify Rapify
